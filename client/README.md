# Storefront Preview

Run a production-like preview locally and open it from any device on your network:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

With the Vite preview server set to `0.0.0.0` on port `4173`, your preview URL will be:

```
http://localhost:4173
```

If you're on a different machine, replace `localhost` with your host's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:4173`).
