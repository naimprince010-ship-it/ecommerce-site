# Client

This directory contains the front-end application for the e-commerce project. We will build the user interface using **Next.js** and **React**.

To get started locally:
1. Install Node.js and Yarn/NPM.
2. Run `npx create-next-app@latest` to bootstrap the Next.js app.
3. Move the generated files into this `client` directory.

Additional customizations and components will be added here as development progresses.
